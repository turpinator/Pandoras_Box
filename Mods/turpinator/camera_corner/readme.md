camera mount that fits in 1515 corner.  meant to go in the left rear, it is angled down and forward by some amount.

Works with the pictured "wansview 1080P Webcam" and similar PCBs.  Same camera used in Ryan G's Annex K3 Camera mount (https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Annex-Engineering_User_Mods/tree/main/Printers/K3/Ryan_G-K3_Outside_Camera)
btw, you can adjust the focus on these by twisting the lens.  I didnt realize this until i took it apart for this project.  I use one of these with the above mount and thought it was just blurry because i didnt cut a hole in my panel for the camera. :D

PCB installs to board using the ?M2 self tapping screws that came out of the camera case and PCB, or your own supplied M2 self tappers.  No longer than 10mm.

Heres the camera youll need.  I trimmed off the microphone from the PCB as this isnt used anyway.  See above image on lower right corner of PCB -- this is where the microphone was.
