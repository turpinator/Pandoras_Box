camera mount that fits in 1515 corner.  meant to go in the left rear, it is angled down and forward by some amount.

Works with the pictured "wansview 1080P Webcam" and similar PCBs.  Same camera used in Ryan G's Annex K3 Camera mount (https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Annex-Engineering_User_Mods/tree/main/Printers/K3/Ryan_G-K3_Outside_Camera)

Heres the camera youll need.  I trimmed off the microphone from the PCB as this isnt used anyway.
