the x carriage from zruncho3d's vampire bat v0 gantry, with the probe mounts from PB.

also a version with probe mount heat set screws moved ever so slightly to match beacon.
with yavoth, spacing is Y +20mm for beacon point.  No X offset.
Loses a few mm in the rear to motor/beacon interference, or plan carefully.
Im lazy for now so I made 5mm thick beacon saver/spacers that go into the rear horizontal extrusion to limit travel.
Also includes a super quick 20mm spacer for mounting beacon on Yavoth normal length.
