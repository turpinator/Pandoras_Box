these are my dumb electronics mounts for now.  Eventually there will be a sheet of something rigid with holes/threads/standoffs for everything.

This will fit...
M8P
UHP-350
SSR
in a +50xy frame with G2z.  probably not normal. maybe. let me know if you try normal or BMGz and i shall update.
Sorry normies.

Its terrible and dumb, but it works.
The cooling fans are half blocked, 
the USB ports are not acessible, 
you probably didnt preload the needed nuts,
and there is no proper cooling for the SSR and UHP (probably okay for now tbh tho).

Also included is a G2z skirt with some holes for mounting a BTT SSKM and USB hub.
