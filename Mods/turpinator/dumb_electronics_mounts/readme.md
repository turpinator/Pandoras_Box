these are my dumb electronics mounts for now.  Eventually there will be a sheet of something rigid with holes/threads/standoffs for everything.

This will fit:
  -M8P
  -UHP-350
  -SSR
in a +50xy frame with G2z.  probably not normal z. maybe. let me know if you try normal or BMGz and i shall update.  (dont use this, its dumb. please only use it for inspiration of what NOT to do)
Also i dont think regular Z would be good in a +50 anyway...

Its terrible and dumb, but it works.
The cooling fans are half blocked, 
the USB ports are not acessible, 
you probably didnt preload the needed nuts,
and there is no proper cooling for the SSR and UHP (probably okay for now tbh tho).

Install M3 heat set inserts into the holes for the M8P and UHP.
The SSR is only secureded by one screw into plastic -- I drilled a second hole and ran the screw into the plastic also.

I printed all pieces with the electronic mounting surface to the bed.
Support was required on the M8P mount for the fan cut-outs because i was too lazy to redesign.


Also included is a G2z skirt with some holes for mounting a BTT SSKM and USB hub.  It goes on the left side where the power normally is -- I put my power on the right.
